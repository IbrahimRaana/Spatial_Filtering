📂 Upload Images (JPG, PNG, BMP, TIFF, etc.)

🎛️ Add Noise (Gaussian, Salt & Pepper) for testing filter robustness

🧮 Apply Filters:

Mean Filter

Median Filter

Mode Filter

Laplacian Sharpening

Sobel Edge Detection

🔧 Adjustable kernel size for non-linear & linear filters

⚡ Option to smooth before sharpening

📊 Side-by-side comparison of original vs processed image

📝 Export results as a PDF Analysis Report (with filter expressions & visual results)
